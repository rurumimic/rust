### Data Race

Rust prevents this problem by refusing to compile code with data races!

happens when these three behaviors occur:

- Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
- At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
- Thereâ€™s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.
